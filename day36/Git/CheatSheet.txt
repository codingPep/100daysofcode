GIT 

Git is the open source distributed version control system that facilitates GitHub activities on
your laptop or desktop




CREATING REPOSITORIES

$ git init
Turn an existing directory into a git repository

$ git clone [url]
Clone (download) a repository that already exists on
GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits





GIT IGNORE

Sometimes it may be a good idea to exclude files from being
tracked with Git. This is typically done in a special file named
 .gitignore . You can find helpful templates for .gitignore
files at github.com/github/gitignore.



CONFIGURE TOOLING 


Configure user information for all local repositories

$ git config --global color.ui auto
Enables helpful colorization of command line output

$ git config --global user.email "[email address]"
Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions

$ git config --global user.name "[name]"
Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions





BRANCHES
Branches are an important part of working with Git. Any
commits you make will be made on the branch you're currently
“checked out” to. Use git status to see which branch that is.


$ git branch [branch-name]
Creates a new branch

$ git checkout [branch-name]
Switches to the specified branch and updates the
working directory


$ git merge [branch]
Combines the specified branch’s history into the
current branch. This is usually done in pull requests,
but is an important Git operation.


$ git branch -d [branch-name]
Deletes the specified branch



SYNCHRONIZE CHANGES

$ git fetch
Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches

$ git merge
Combines remote tracking branch into current local branch

$ git push
Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub

$ git pull
Updates your current local working branch with all new
commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub.
 git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge 




MAKE CHANGES
Browse and inspect the evolution of project files

$ git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch]
Shows content differences between two branches

$ git log --follow [file]
Lists version history for a file, including renames

$ git log
Lists version history for the current branch

$ git show [commit]
Outputs metadata and content changes of the specified commit

$ git add [file]
Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning

$ git commit -m "[descriptive message]"
Records file snapshots permanently in version history




REDO COMMITS
Erase mistakes and craft replacement history

$ git reset [commit]
Undoes all commits after [commit], preserving changes locally

$ git reset --hard [commit]
Discards all history and changes back to the specified commit
